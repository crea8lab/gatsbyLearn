A lot of people ask me:

> Favour, why do I have to use Gatsby?

That is an interesting question, before I answer this though, I want to draw your attention to what Gatsby thinks... This is Gatsby's answer to the question - why Gatsby

> Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps

There are a couple more reasons why I think you need Gatsby...

- **Gatsby is a Modern web tech without the headache**

Gatsby provides you the power of the latest web technologies – React.js , Webpack , modern JavaScript and CSS and more — all set up and waiting for you to start building. How cool is that?

- **Bring your own data**

With Gatsby’s rich data plugin ecosystem, you build sites with the data you want — from one or many sources: you have the options of pulling data from **headless CMSs**, **SaaS services**, **APIs**, **databases**, **your file system**, and more directly into your pages using GraphQL .
